# FutureProof Capstone Project

FutureProof is an innovative application that combines the features of Strava and Pou to help users track and improve their well-being. The app reflects the user's self-care through a virtual character that evolves based on recorded activities, food intake, and other lifestyle choices.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Geolocation**
   - Track user activities such as walking, running, or cycling using real-time location data.

2. **Predictive and Sentiment Analysis**
   - Analyze user input and activity data to predict trends and assess user sentiment for personalized feedback.

3. **Virtual Character**
   - A digital avatar that visually represents the user's self-care and well-being, evolving with user actions.

4. **Image Recognition**
   - Recognize and log food items or activities using image analysis to automate data entry.

5. **Social Network**
   - Connect with friends, share achievements, and participate in challenges within a supportive community.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** (e.g., React Native, React)  
- **Backend:** (e.g., Node.js, Express, Python Flask/Django)  
- **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  
- **Geolocation APIs:** (e.g., Google Maps API, Mapbox)  
- **Machine Learning:** (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn, spaCy for sentiment analysis)  
- **Image Recognition:** (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, or cloud-based APIs)  
- **Authentication & Social:** (e.g., OAuth, Firebase Auth)
