# Lifora Capstone Project

Lifora is an innovative application that combines the features of Strava and Pou to help users track and improve their well-being. The app reflects the user's self-care through a virtual character that evolves based on recorded activities, food intake, and other lifestyle choices.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Geolocation**
   - Track user activities such as walking, running, or cycling using real-time location data.

2. **Predictive and Sentiment Analysis**
   - Analyze user input and activity data to predict trends and assess user sentiment for personalized feedback.

3. **Virtual Character**
   - A digital avatar that visually represents the user's self-care and well-being, evolving with user actions.

4. **Image Recognition**
   - Recognize and log food items or activities using image analysis to automate data entry.

5. **Social Network**
   - Connect with friends, share achievements, and participate in challenges within a supportive community.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** (e.g., React Native, React)  
- **Backend:** (e.g., Node.js, Express, Python Flask/Django)  
- **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  
- **Geolocation APIs:** (e.g., Google Maps API, Mapbox)  
- **Machine Learning:** (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn, spaCy for sentiment analysis)  
- **Image Recognition:** (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, or cloud-based APIs)  
- **Authentication & Social:** (e.g., OAuth, Firebase Auth)  

## Project Overview

Lifora motivates users to take care of themselves by making healthy choices visible and rewarding. The more users engage in positive activities and habits, the healthier and happier their virtual character becomes.
